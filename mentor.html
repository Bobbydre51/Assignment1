            BIOGRAPHY OF MY MENTOR
        </h2>
        <P>
            One of my greatest living mentors is and remains Prof. Christian Echeta. He was born into the family of Late.Mr & Mrs Christian Echeta, the Headmaster of the prestigious Holy Trinity Primary School in the historic town of Igbo-Ukwu, Aguata Local Government Area in Anambra State, Nigeria.The fourth child of a Ten-member family of seven boys and three girls, <i>(now seven men and three women)</i> Prof. Christian along his other siblings, followed his father from one station to another on tranfers in line with the itenarant nature of teaching profession.These movements compelled the young Christian to be changing schools as frequently as his father moved.In 1964, at St. Gabriel's Primary School, Prof.Echeta's art and creative prowess erupted and started to seek expression in class and <i>handwork</i> activities.While others were processing brooms and weaving baskets and fish traps, Prof. was officially permitted to do his drawings and paintings on cardboards and with colour chalks on class walls for instructional purposes. The first time manifestation of childlike creative instincts were in the raising of wet sand mounds out of which he built <i>'houses</i> and <i>'sand shoes'</i>
